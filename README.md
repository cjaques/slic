# slic
SLIC superpixel/supervoxel segmentation algorithm from http://ivrl.epfl.ch/supplementary_material/RK_SLICSuperpixels/index.html 

This is a Python wrapper of a C++ implementation of the SLIC algorithm, as detailed on the website hereabove.
For anyone interested in using this piece of code, I appologize for there are a few hardlinks (pathes) that may be different on your machine.
Check the setup.py file and make sure it corresponds to your system.
